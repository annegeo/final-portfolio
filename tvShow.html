        <h1>TV Show Review</h1>
        <p class = "intro"> In my freetime I love watching tv shows. I love to watch characters develop and grow across seasons and watch a variety of different genres.
            Now in no particular order, here are some TV Shows I've watched, my thoughts on them, what they're similar to and my overall rating. Feel free to leave your own rating! 
        </p>

                <h2>The Watcher</h2>
                <img src = "images/theWatcher.jpeg" width="800" alt = "house with a sillouette of someone outside">
                <p>A great thriller! A new Netflix original based off a true story. A family moves into a new neighborhood when they begin to get threatening letters from someone called "The Watcher". Super easy to binge watch as it's only one season</p>

                <img src = "images/TWD.jpeg" width="800" alt = "four individuals with weapons like crossbows and knives. Approaching them is a sea of zombies">
                <p> Love this show! When the zombie apocalypse begins, watch the journey of a group of survivors. I truly believe this show makes you reflect about the lengths one would go in order to survive. Very gory, but very good. Roughly 11 seasons, with 45 min episode so definitely a time commitment  </p>

                <img src = "images/OMITB.jpg" width="800" alt = "Multiple slanted multi-colored doors with the three main characters sitting and smiling out of an open door">
                <p> A more recent show starring the famous trio of Selena Gomez, Chris Martin and Martin Short. I would describe it as a myster-comedy as it isn't very serious but still very interesting! The comedy is a little quirky but as are the actors. A good show to watch when eating.</p>

                <p>One of my favorite shows ever! It's hilarious, feel good, and you fall in love with all the characters. New Girl is about Jess who moves into a loft in LA with all male roommates and the shenanigans that insue. Highly reccommend if you enjoy sitcoms</p>

                <p>Classic sitcom that's iconic! Follows a friendgroup in New York City as they deal with love, roommates, jobs and friendship. My parents own all 10 seasons on DVDs</p>

                <p>This show is the eptiome of feel good sitcom. It follows the main character Ted as he tells the story of how he met his wife to his kids! It follows his best friends and honestly teaches some great life lessons. Questionable ending. </p>

                <img src = "images/bigMouth.jpeg" width="800" alt = "yellow background with 5 cartoon teenagers holding their crotch area. Title Big Mouth in bold white text at top">
                <p>Cartoon show about teeneagers going through puberty where they all have different fictional characters (aka Monsters) for their emotions. Honestly so funny but very middle school humor. Nick Kroll is so talented and voices a ton of the characters.</p>

                <p>Arguably one of the best sitcoms of all time. Has a stacked cast and great writing! It's a show about a paper selling company, and although it sounds mundane it's anything but that. I've laughed, cried, and loved with this show. 10 seasons but super short episodes</p>

                <p>Now I personally enjoy Parks and Recreation more than the Office, which is saying something of its caliber. It's about the Parks and Rec department of Pawnee, Indiana and the whacky stuff they deal with. The characters all have their quirks but are all lovable in their own way. 7 seasons</p>

                <p>A narrative version of the infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. It shows reenactments of his childhood to some of his terrible murders, and the effects on the victims family as it went to trial. Truly disturbing, but reccommend if you enjoy true crime.</p>

                <p>A spinoff of How I Met Your Mother. Not at ALL related so could be watched as a stand alone show. Only 1 season out so far but it's decent. The comedy is a bit different than the original but it has Hillary Duff who's an icon.

                <p> Documentary style show following teachers at Abbott Elementary. They're underfunded, overworked, but are making the most of the situation. My mom is a teacher so this show really reminds me of stuff she deals with at work. Very funny and fresh! Only 1 season and in the middle of the 2nd!</p>

                <p>I LOVE THIS SHOW. Follows the mother daugher duo Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. This show covers everything from school to relationships to family issues. So feel good and just reminds me of home, not entirely sure why.</p>

                <img src = "images/loveIsland.jpg" width="800" alt = "Various contestants in swimsuits and bikinis against a pink backdrop. A few are holding up large flags that say LOVE. ">
                <p>Reality TV show where contestants are at a private vila trying to find true love. It's messy, funny, and full of ~love~. Pretty similar to Bachelor or Too Hot to Handle, but in my opinion better. Plus, the British accents are iconic. Innit luv? </p>

                <p> Reenactment of the famous trial of The People vs OJ Simpson. As someone who wasn't too old when the trial was going on, this gave the background perfectly. If you enjoy more crime/justice relaeted shows this is a great option!</p>

                <p> The title says it all. Annalise Keating is a law professor who is a bada**. She hires interns who are top of the class law students, but things get messy, fast. This show made me realize how truly corrupt our justice system is and how even the good guys are a little bad and the bad guys are a little good. </p>
