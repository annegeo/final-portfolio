            <p>
                Hey everyone! My name is Anne George and welcome to my personal website! I grew up in Novi, Michigan. I have lived in Michigan my whole life and am currently a senior at the University of Michigan (go blue!). 
                I am graduating May 2023 with a B.S.E in Computer Science and a minor in UX. In my free time I love to spend time with my friends and family (I have 9 first cousins that live in a 10 minute drive from my house so safe to say I see them a lot). 
                I'm passionate about travelling, enjoy spending time outdoors, and love to try new things.
